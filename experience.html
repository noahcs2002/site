            In the Winter of 2023, I applied for a job at HCLTech - Cleveland, for an internship position on the UC-Deploy team.
            The job entailed managing the "UrbanCode Deploy" product, a DevOps product for easier code deployments. For full details of

                For my first internship, the summer of my Sophomore year, I applied for and was offered an internship at a local 
                company that services utility companies, called United Systems and Software. Here I was the Technical Lead for the internship
                program, and served in that position until March of 2023, when the internship program changed direction, and I left shortly there after.
