                    My name is Noah Sternberg, and I am a senior at Murray State University, studying 
                    Computer Science and Mathematics. I was born in Evansville, Indiana, and moved to Paducah, Kentucky
                    shortly there after, where I stayed my whole life, until moving to Murray, Kentucky for college.
                    When starting college, I was a Mathematics major with an undeclared minor, before declaring my minor as 
                    Computer Science, until I realised computer science is what I want to do with my life, when I switched to
                    a Computer Science major and Mathematics minor. 

                </p>

                    When I am not doing work for classes or my job at the time, I tend to find myself reading or playing video games. I also 
                    frequently listen to music, and work on some personal projects, like this website for example. You can
                    find more info about what I am up to, like the book I'm reading, the show I'm watching etc on the <a href="./personal.html">"What am I ____" page</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of my programming interests, I quite enjoy programming langauge development and compiler theory, as well as
                    DevOps development. I have experience making RESTful APIs, as well as DevOps software, and modifying front end code as well.
                    For more information on any of that, feel free to check out <a href="./education.html">Education</a> or <a href="./experience.html">Work</a>, and to see my current projects pertaining to
                    my interests, feel free to see <a href="./projects.html">Projects.</a>
