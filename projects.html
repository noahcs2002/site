                <p>
                    For my Junior year in college, I took an Advanced Object Oriented Programming class, which covered
                    all of the advanced OO concepts, like polymorphism, inheritence, abstraction, encapsulation, etc.
                    For this class, we could take a final exam, or tie all the concepts we learned together into one big project,
                    and that's what I chose to do. I made a small software package called "Manage-Mint Express" (which, I'm not sold)
                    on the name, but it served as a little-league/rec-league baseball team manager, with stat tracking and such.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I plan to, eventually, convert this to a web app and potentially sell it to local teams, and offer
                    to maintain it for a year in the package. I think converting it to a webapp will allow me to have a bit of 
                    a bigger range of options for the UI than than Java's Swing library does. Plus it would allow it to be used 
                    in the field, rather than just in an office.

                    This website is my first dip into the web dev field. I am a more traditional back end dev,
                    and beyond that, I love making command line tools, so web dev isn't someting that I would 
                    traditionally see myself doing, but I want a portfolio website, so I've decided to learn how 
                    to use HTML, CSS, and JS, in an attempt to not just brute force my way through, but rather actually
                    learn the craft as a whole.

                    This site is a massive work in progress, and shouldn't ever be viewed as "done." Even if the site is 
                    visually done and dusted, it's important to know that I am always learning and updating this site, both in
                    terms of the content and in terms of techniques and styles.

                I am (slowly at least) learning Dutch, with the hopes of visiting (or one day immigrating to) The Netherlands,
                and I think making a site for me to practice my Dutch usage would be useful. I plan to make a RESTful API that 
                queries a database that stores vocab, and probably some sentences for translations.

                For my Programming Languages and Compiler Theory class, we designed and implemented a (terrible)
                programming language that was imperative and compiled.
