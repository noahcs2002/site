                        <p>
                            This project was the first large-scale project that I worked on, and it was largely success. I learned a lot of valuable
                            things by choosing to do this project. For instance, I learned how easy Scope Creep can happen with a project, and how important
                            it is to not overcommit to an MVP when planning out a project.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I also took care to make sure to integrate source control and versioning into my product, and that ended up saving me twice.
                            Once I lost the code that establised connections to my database in a commit error, and I was able to recover it from the 
                            versioning system, and it helped again when I was able to take advantage of an older software design style called Nightly Building, 
                            where I, as a habit, made a point to do make a new branch from master before every push to master to keep one branch that is
                            one commit behind master, in case of any unforeseen side effects.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If I were to do this project again, given no constraints (as I had a lengthly list of constraints in place for the assignment) I would choose
                            to do a webapp, as opposed to a Java program. Webapps would make it so that the user could use it from anywhere, rather than just from an office.
                            Plus it would allow more graphical options, rather than trying to rely on Java's Swing library for graphical enhancements.
                        </p>
