                        <p>
                            When I joined United Systems and Software, I joined a renaissance of the internship program. Prior to my hire,
                            there were 4 interns in the program over the previous years. This time, however, the company hired me, a senior, a grad student,
                            and a post grad student all at once to take the helm of the program. Myself and a pair of excellent colleages worked as 
                            the leads of the program, with me as the technial back-end lead, and the other two serving as the front-end lead and project
                            manager.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While I was with the company, I took on various roles and responsibilities with my duties. I served as the API architect for a 
                            site to handle product release notes and information. Here I learned how to manage RESTful APIs for the first time, as well as 
                            handling LDAP for the first time, using C#'s Identity framework. I also handled database relationship interactions
                            using C#'s Entity Framework, as well as running Code-First Migrations.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I also took part in all processes of the Agile developement environment: joining daily standups, 
                            biweekly sprint planning and sprint review, as well as weekly floor meetings across the whole developement
                            floor teams.
                        </p>
