                        <p>
                            I joined HCLTech in May of 2023 for my Summer internship, and I couldn't have enjoyed my time there more.
                            I joined a team of 6 people, though my contacts were limited (for the most part) to my supervisor Rick, my 
                            mentors Koby and Jeff, and the person who reported my primary work item, Brian.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While I worked there, I tackled 4 things. First was a sample project to help me get familiar with the product I was working
                            on, which was a DevOps product aimed at code deployments. Then I worked on a ticket to change something in the front end of the code.
                            The main thing I worked on, however, was an internal tool to help prevent developers from putting database changes into a previous
                            version of the product, which causes issues down the road. I also got started on another ticket that dealt with a procedure that can be ran within
                            the app, but that didn't get done in the time I worked there.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While I worked there, we had daily scrum meetings, I had a weekly one on one meeting with my boss, and 
                            we also had regular design meetings, as well as retro and planning (standard agile meetings). I worked using
                            the Java language, and the Dojo front end framework, as well as the Ant build system, and, of course,
                            Git.
